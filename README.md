## Overview

- Android application that grabs vehicle data from a dealership API and displays the exact location of the car. This application will solve the real world problem for car sales staff having to locate cars on ancillary lots while their clients wait countless minutes for them to return. This app will allow verified users to access a dealership database of inventory and locate the last known location of the vehicle to easily point the sales staff to that location drastically reducing the wait time and improving overall customer experience.
